# Attendance_using_FC-2D
## Project Description
- This is a face recognition project built using the face_recognition Python library. The project aims to recognize faces in images or live video streams and perform various tasks, such as marking attendance or identifying known individuals.The face recognition model is trained on a dataset of registered individuals, and it uses deep learning techniques to encode and compare facial features, making it accurate and reliable.

## Features
- Face detection and recognition in images and live video streams.
- Attendance marking for recognized individuals.
- Ability to add new individuals to the database for recognition.
- Real-time face recognition with video feed.
- Easy-to-use Python Module
